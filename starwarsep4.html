      <p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title.</p>
      <p>War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls</p>
      <p>into infinity.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships,</p>
      <p>striking from a hidden base, have won their first</p>
      <p>victory against the evil Galactic Empire.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal</p>
      <p>secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the</p>
      <p>Death Star, an armored space station with enough</p>
      <p>power to destroy an entire planet.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess</p>
      <p>Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of</p>
      <p>the stolen plans that can save her people and</p>
      <p>restore freedom to the galaxy...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total</p>
      <p>eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny</p>
      <p>silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers</p>
      <p>from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed</p>
      <p>by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly</p>
      <p>laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing</p>
      <p>the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-</p>
      <p>D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way</p>
      <p>through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are</p>
      <p>old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His</p>
      <p>face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye.</p>
      <p>Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of</p>
      <p>human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic</p>
      <p>surface of an Art Deco design.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Did you hear that? They've shut down</p>
      <p>the main reactor. We'll be destroyed</p>
      <p>for sure. This is madness!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in</p>
      <p>the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>We're doomed!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that</p>
      <p>only another robot could understand.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>There'll be no escape for the Princess</p>
      <p>this time.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as</p>
      <p>loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment</p>
      <p>are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>What's that?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade</p>
      <p>Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the</p>
      <p>underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a</p>
      <p>tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and</p>
      <p>a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make</p>
      <p>their way into the smoke-filled corridor.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with</p>
      <p>laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns</p>
      <p>creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck</p>
      <p>behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers</p>
      <p>who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered</p>
      <p>arms and faces.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>An explosion hits near the robots.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>I should have known better than to</p>
      <p>trust the logic of a half-sized</p>
      <p>thermocapsulary dehousing assister...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages</p>
      <p>around the two hapless robots.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon.</p>
      <p>The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone</p>
      <p>figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations</p>
      <p>who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy</p>
      <p>hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable</p>
      <p>lad with a prize-winning smile.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a</p>
      <p>large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the</p>
      <p>desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided</p>
      <p>by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot</p>
      <p>appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.</p>
      <p>A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and</p>
      <p>he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his</p>
      <p>utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying</p>
      <p>the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired</p>
      <p>Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet</p>
      <p>above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the</p>
      <p>tiny robot to follow him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Hurry up! Come with me! What are you</p>
      <p>waiting for?! Get in gear!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and</p>
      <p>smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his</p>
      <p>arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps</p>
      <p>into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum</p>
      <p>madly.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his</p>
      <p>way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is</p>
      <p>Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured</p>
      <p>by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which</p>
      <p>stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the</p>
      <p>Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away</p>
      <p>from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through</p>
      <p>the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run</p>
      <p>in a frenzied panic.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.</p>
      <p>Artoo makes beeping sounds.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is</p>
      <p>nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel</p>
      <p>soldiers can be heard in the distance.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and</p>
      <p>he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-</p>
      <p>filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years</p>
      <p>old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place,</p>
      <p>dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting</p>
      <p>something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little</p>
      <p>robot joins his companion.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>At last! Where have you been?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>They're heading in this direction.</p>
      <p>What are we going to do? We'll be</p>
      <p>sent to the spice mine of Kessel or</p>
      <p>smashed into who knows what!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the</p>
      <p>subhallway. Threepio chases after him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Wait a minute, where are you going?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo responds with electronic beeps.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies</p>
      <p>of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as</p>
      <p>an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>IMPERIAL OFFICER</p>
      <p>The Death Star plans are not in the</p>
      <p>main computer.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles</p>
      <p>in vain.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>VADER</p>
      <p>Where are those transmissions you</p>
      <p>intercepted?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>VADER</p>
      <p>What have you done with those plans?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>REBEL OFFICER</p>
      <p>We intercepted no transmissions.</p>
      <p>Aaah... This is a consular ship.</p>
      <p>Were on a diplomatic mission.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>VADER</p>
      <p>If this is a consular ship... were</p>
      <p>is the Ambassador?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the</p>
      <p>Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a</p>
      <p>gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp.</p>
      <p>Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to</p>
      <p>his troops.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>VADER</p>
      <p>Commander, tear this ship apart until</p>
      <p>you've found those plans and bring</p>
      <p>me the Ambassador. I want her alive!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the</p>
      <p>stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia</p>
      <p>Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her</p>
      <p>eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds</p>
      <p>of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the</p>
      <p>troopers spots her.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>TROOPER</p>
      <p>There she is! Set for stun!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with</p>
      <p>her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a</p>
      <p>paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>TROOPER</p>
      <p>She'll be all right. Inform Lord</p>
      <p>Vader we have a prisoner.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod.</p>
      <p>He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light</p>
      <p>begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into</p>
      <p>the cramped four-man pod.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Hey, you're not permitted in there.</p>
      <p>It's restricted. You'll be deactivated</p>
      <p>for sure..</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo beeps something to him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Don't call me a mindless philosopher,</p>
      <p>you overweight glob of grease! Now</p>
      <p>come out before somebody sees you.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding</p>
      <p>the mission he is about to perform.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Secret mission? What plans? What are</p>
      <p>you talking about? I'm not getting</p>
      <p>in there!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps</p>
      <p>and twangs angrily.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris</p>
      <p>through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and,</p>
      <p>after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky</p>
      <p>robot jumps into the lifepod.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>I'm going to regret this.</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white</p>
      <p>buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty</p>
      <p>empty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to</p>
      <p>get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist</p>
      <p>at Luke as he flies past.</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged</p>
      <p>mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been</p>
      <p>asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the</p>
      <p>office, yelling wildly.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>FIXER</p>
      <p>Did I hear a young noise blast through</p>
      <p>here?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>CAMIE</p>
      <p>It was just wormie on another rampage.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak</p>
      <p>and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are</p>
      <p>playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly,</p>
      <p>handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy</p>
      <p>city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics</p>
      <p>of the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the</p>
      <p>background.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great</p>
      <p>joy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>I didn't know you were back! When</p>
      <p>did you get in?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BIGGS</p>
      <p>Just now. I wanted to surprise you,</p>
      <p>hot shot. I thought you'd be here...</p>
      <p>certainly didn't expect you to be</p>
      <p>out working.</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>The Academy didn't change you</p>
      <p>much...but you're back so soon? Hey,</p>
      <p>what happened, didn't you get your</p>
      <p>commission?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BIGGS</p>
      <p>Of course I got it. Signed aboard</p>
      <p>The Rand Ecliptic last week. First</p>
      <p>mate Biggs Darklighter at your</p>
      <p>service...</p>

      <p>Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend</p>
      <p>is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of</p>
      <p>it.</p>

      <p>BIGGS</p>
      <p>That's no battle, hot shot... they're</p>
      <p>just sitting there! Probably a</p>
      <p>freighter-tanker refueling.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>But there was a lot of firing</p>
      <p>earlier...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the</p>
      <p>building in the process. Luke grabs them.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Hey, easy with those...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>CAMIE</p>
      <p>Don't worry about it, Wormie.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs</p>
      <p>his shoulders in resignation.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>FIXER</p>
      <p>I keep telling you, the Rebellion is</p>
      <p>a long way from here. I doubt if the</p>
      <p>Empire would even fight to keep this</p>
      <p>system. Believe me Luke, this planet</p>
      <p>is a big hunk of nothing...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The</p>
      <p>group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about</p>
      <p>Luke's ineptitude.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad</p>
      <p>of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is</p>
      <p>brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly</p>
      <p>marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader</p>
      <p>emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard</p>
      <p>at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>Lord Vader, I should have known.</p>
      <p>Only you could be so bold. The</p>
      <p>Imperial Senate will not sit for</p>
      <p>this, when they hear you've attacked</p>
      <p>a diplomatic...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>VADER</p>
      <p>Don't play games with me, Your</p>
      <p>Highness. You weren't on any mercy</p>
      <p>mission this time. You passed directly</p>
      <p>through a restricted system. Several</p>
      <p>transmissions were beamed to this</p>
      <p>ship by Rebel spies. I want to know</p>
      <p>what happened to the plans they sent</p>
      <p>you.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>I don't know what you're talking</p>
      <p>about. I'm a member of the Imperial</p>
      <p>Senate on a diplomatic mission to</p>
      <p>Alderaan...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>VADER</p>
      <p>You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...</p>
      <p>and a traitor. Take her away!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering</p>
      <p>hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander</p>
      <p>turns to Vader.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>COMMANDER</p>
      <p>Holding her is dangerous. If word of</p>
      <p>this gets out, it could generate</p>
      <p>sympathy for the Rebellion in the</p>
      <p>senate.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>VADER</p>
      <p>I have traced the Rebel spies to</p>
      <p>her. Now she is my only link to find</p>
      <p>their secret base!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>COMMANDER</p>
      <p>She'll die before she tells you</p>
      <p>anything.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>VADER</p>
      <p>Leave that to me. Send a distress</p>
      <p>signal and then inform the senate</p>
      <p>that all aboard were killed!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander.</p>
      <p>They stop and snap to attention.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>SECOND OFFICER</p>
      <p>Lord Vader, the battle station plans</p>
      <p>are not aboard this ship! And no</p>
      <p>transmissions were made. An escape</p>
      <p>pod was jettisoned during the</p>
      <p>fighting, but no life forms were</p>
      <p>aboard.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Vader turns to the Commander.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>VADER</p>
      <p>She must have hidden the plans in</p>
      <p>the escape pod. Send a detachment</p>
      <p>down to retrieve them. See to it</p>
      <p>personally, Commander. There'll be</p>
      <p>no one to stop us this time.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>COMMANDER</p>
      <p>Yes, sir.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>EXT. SPACE</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the</p>
      <p>planet Tatooine.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas</p>
      <p>meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids</p>
      <p>kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily</p>
      <p>work their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in</p>
      <p>the distance rests half buried in the sand.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>How did I get into this mess? I really</p>
      <p>don't know how. We seem to be made</p>
      <p>to suffer. It's our lot in life.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo answers with beeping sounds.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>I've got to rest before I fall apart.</p>
      <p>My joints are almost frozen.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>What a desolate place this is.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts</p>
      <p>off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio</p>
      <p>stops and yells at him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Where are you going?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small</p>
      <p>robot.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Well, I'm not going that way. It's</p>
      <p>much too rocky. This way is much</p>
      <p>easier.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo counters with a long whistle.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>What makes you think there are</p>
      <p>settlements over there?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Don't get technical with me.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>What mission? What are you talking</p>
      <p>about? I've had just about enough of</p>
      <p>you! Go that way! You'll be</p>
      <p>malfunctioning within a day, you</p>
      <p>nearsighted scrap pile!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the</p>
      <p>direction of the vast dune sea.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>And don't let me catch you following</p>
      <p>me begging for help, because you</p>
      <p>won't get it.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges</p>
      <p>off in the direction of the towering mesas.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>No more adventures. I'm not going</p>
      <p>that way.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant</p>
      <p>mountains.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>EXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a</p>
      <p>dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless</p>
      <p>miles. He looks back in the direction of the now distant</p>
      <p>rock mesas.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>That malfunctioning little twerp.</p>
      <p>This is all his fault! He tricked me</p>
      <p>into going this way, but he'll do no</p>
      <p>better.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand</p>
      <p>from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of</p>
      <p>reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving</p>
      <p>towards him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm</p>
      <p>saved!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the</p>
      <p>approaching transport.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Over here! Help! Please, help!</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer</p>
      <p>and the others can be heard working inside.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>(Very animated)</p>
      <p>...so I cut off my power, shut down</p>
      <p>the afterburners and came in low on</p>
      <p>Deak's trail. I was so close I thought</p>
      <p>I was going to fry my instruments.</p>
      <p>As it was I busted up the Skyhopper</p>
      <p>pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty</p>
      <p>upset. He grounded me for the rest</p>
      <p>of the season. You should have been</p>
      <p>there... it was fantastic.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BIGGS</p>
      <p>You ought to take it easy Luke. You</p>
      <p>may be the hottest bushpilot this</p>
      <p>side of Mos Eisley, but those little</p>
      <p>Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it</p>
      <p>up, and one day, whammo, you're going</p>
      <p>to be nothing more than a dark spot</p>
      <p>on the down side of a canyon wall.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Look who's talking. Now that you've</p>
      <p>been around those giant starships</p>
      <p>you're beginning to sound like my</p>
      <p>uncle. You've gotten soft in the</p>
      <p>city...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BIGGS</p>
      <p>I've missed you kid.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Well, things haven't been the same</p>
      <p>since you left, Biggs. It's been</p>
      <p>so... quiet.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BIGGS</p>
      <p>Luke, I didn't come back just to say</p>
      <p>good-bye... I shouldn't tell you</p>
      <p>this, but you're the only one I can</p>
      <p>trust... and if I don't come back, I</p>
      <p>want somebody to know.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>What are you talking about?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BIGGS</p>
      <p>I made some friends at the Academy.</p>
      <p>(he whispers)</p>
      <p>...when our frigate goes to one of</p>
      <p>the central systems, we're going to</p>
      <p>jump ship and join the Alliance...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding!</p>
      <p>How?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BIGGS</p>
      <p>Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth</p>
      <p>bigger than a meteor crater!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>I'm sorry. I'm quiet.</p>
      <p>(he whispers)</p>
      <p>Listen how quiet I am. You can barely</p>
      <p>hear me...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BIGGS</p>
      <p>My friend has a friend on Bestine</p>
      <p>who might help us make contact.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>You're crazy! You could wander around</p>
      <p>forever trying to find them.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BIGGS</p>
      <p>I know it's a long shot, but if I</p>
      <p>don't find them I'll do what I can</p>
      <p>on my own... It's what we always</p>
      <p>talked about. Luke, I'm not going to</p>
      <p>wait for the Empire to draft me into</p>
      <p>service. The Rebellion is spreading</p>
      <p>and I want to be on the right side --</p>
      <p>the side I believe in.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>And I'm stuck here...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BIGGS</p>
      <p>I thought you were going to the</p>
      <p>Academy next term. You'll get your</p>
      <p>chance to get off this rock.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Not likely! I had to cancel my</p>
      <p>application. There has been a lot of</p>
      <p>unrest among the Sandpeople since</p>
      <p>you left... they've even raided the</p>
      <p>outskirts of Anchorhead.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BIGGS</p>
      <p>Your uncle could hold off a whole</p>
      <p>colony of Sandpeople with one blaster.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>I know, but he's got enough vaporators</p>
      <p>going to make the place pay off. He</p>
      <p>needs me for just one more season. I</p>
      <p>can't leave him now.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BIGGS</p>
      <p>I feel for you, Luke, you're going</p>
      <p>to have to learn what seems to be</p>
      <p>important or what really is important.</p>
      <p>What good is all your uncle's work</p>
      <p>if it's taken over by the Empire?...</p>
      <p>You know they're starting to</p>
      <p>nationalize commerce in the central</p>
      <p>systems... it won't be long before</p>
      <p>your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving</p>
      <p>for the greater glory of the Empire.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>It couldn't happen here. You said it</p>
      <p>yourself. The Empire won't bother</p>
      <p>with this rock.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BIGGS</p>
      <p>Things always change.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>I wish I was going... Are you going</p>
      <p>to be around long?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BIGGS</p>
      <p>No, I'm leaving in the morning...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Then I guess I won't see you.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BIGGS</p>
      <p>Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Well, I'll be at the Academy next</p>
      <p>season... after that who knows. I</p>
      <p>won't be drafted into the Imperial</p>
      <p>Starfleet that's for sure... Take</p>
      <p>care of yourself, you'll always be</p>
      <p>the best friend I've got.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BIGGS</p>
      <p>So long, Luke.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the</p>
      <p>power station.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange</p>
      <p>foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures</p>
      <p>fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock</p>
      <p>canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he</p>
      <p>goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for</p>
      <p>a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall</p>
      <p>and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little</p>
      <p>further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a</p>
      <p>pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the</p>
      <p>narrow path.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until</p>
      <p>suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out</p>
      <p>of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages</p>
      <p>one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his</p>
      <p>back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then</p>
      <p>off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller</p>
      <p>than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they</p>
      <p>cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and</p>
      <p>their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be</p>
      <p>seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave</p>
      <p>the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down</p>
      <p>the trail.</p>

      <p>EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-</p>
      <p>like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a</p>
      <p>small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a</p>
      <p>large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot</p>
      <p>is sucked into the giant machine.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders</p>
      <p>and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo</p>
      <p>switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles</p>
      <p>around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty</p>
      <p>metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and</p>
      <p>maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper</p>
      <p>and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end</p>
      <p>of the chamber.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the</p>
      <p>middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various</p>
      <p>shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation,</p>
      <p>while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls</p>
      <p>out from the gloom.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent</p>
      <p>twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain</p>
      <p>ridge.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-</p>
      <p>buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine.</p>
      <p>A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>FIRST TROOPER</p>
      <p>Someone was in the pod. The tracks</p>
      <p>go off in this direction.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand</p>
      <p>and gives it to the first trooper.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>SECOND TROOPER</p>
      <p>Look, sir -- droids.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. SANDCRAWLER</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped</p>
      <p>prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Wake up! Wake up!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops,</p>
      <p>creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.</p>
      <p>Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights</p>
      <p>pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long</p>
      <p>chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding</p>
      <p>white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the</p>
      <p>odd assortment of robots.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>We're doomed.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A Jawa starts moving toward them.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Do you think they'll melt us down?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this</p>
      <p>never end?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their</p>
      <p>battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of</p>
      <p>the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small</p>
      <p>homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground</p>
      <p>surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small</p>
      <p>adobe block house.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening</p>
      <p>them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow.</p>
      <p>The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting</p>
      <p>small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils</p>
      <p>should be.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars,</p>
      <p>a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are</p>
      <p>sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully</p>
      <p>inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump-</p>
      <p>shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little</p>
      <p>Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales</p>
      <p>pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the</p>
      <p>homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru</p>
      <p>standing in the main courtyard.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BERU</p>
      <p>Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a</p>
      <p>translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>It looks like we don't have much of</p>
      <p>a choice but I'll remind him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment</p>
      <p>for sale with the Jawa leader.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>I have no need for a protocol droid.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>(quickly)</p>
      <p>Sir -- not in an environment such as</p>
      <p>this -- that's why I've also been</p>
      <p>programmed for over thirty secondary</p>
      <p>functions that...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>What I really need is a droid that</p>
      <p>understands the binary language of</p>
      <p>moisture vaporators.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was</p>
      <p>programming binary load lifter...</p>
      <p>very similar to your vaporators. You</p>
      <p>could say...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>Do you speak Bocce?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Of course I can, sir. It's like a</p>
      <p>second language for me... I'm as</p>
      <p>fluent in Bocce...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>All right shut up!</p>
      <p>(turning to Jawa)</p>
      <p>I'll take this one.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Shutting up, sir.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>Luke, take these two over to the</p>
      <p>garage, will you? I want you to have</p>
      <p>both of them cleaned up before dinner.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>But I was going into Toshi Station</p>
      <p>to pick up some power converters...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>You can waste time with your friends</p>
      <p>when your chores are done. Now come</p>
      <p>on, get to it!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>All right, come on! And the red one,</p>
      <p>come on. Well, come on, Red, let's</p>
      <p>go.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back</p>
      <p>into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep</p>
      <p>and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained</p>
      <p>by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two</p>
      <p>robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the</p>
      <p>head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Uncle Owen...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>Yeah?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>This R2 unit has a bad motivator.</p>
      <p>Look!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>(to the head Jawa)</p>
      <p>Hey, what're you trying to push on</p>
      <p>us?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked</p>
      <p>out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract</p>
      <p>attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps</p>
      <p>Luke on the shoulder.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>(pointing to Artoo)</p>
      <p>Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is</p>
      <p>in prime condition. A real bargain.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Uncle Owen...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>Yeah?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>What about that one?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>(to Jawa)</p>
      <p>What about that blue one? We'll take</p>
      <p>that one.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged</p>
      <p>astro-droid for Artoo.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Yeah, take it away.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very</p>
      <p>pleased with that one, sir. He really</p>
      <p>is in first-class condition. I've</p>
      <p>worked with him before. Here he comes.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots</p>
      <p>trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Okay, let's go.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>(to Artoo)</p>
      <p>Now, don't you forget this! Why I</p>
      <p>should stick my neck out for you is</p>
      <p>quite beyond my capacity!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful</p>
      <p>atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers</p>
      <p>himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the</p>
      <p>battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery</p>
      <p>with a cord to his face.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Thank the maker! This oil bath is</p>
      <p>going to feel so good. I've got such</p>
      <p>a bad case of dust contamination, I</p>
      <p>can barely move!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought</p>
      <p>as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man</p>
      <p>Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage.</p>
      <p>Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he</p>
      <p>slams a wrench across the workbench.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is</p>
      <p>right. I'm never gonna get out of</p>
      <p>here!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Is there anything I might do to help?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains</p>
      <p>and a tiny smile creeps across his face.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Well, not unless you can alter time,</p>
      <p>speed up the harvest, or teleport me</p>
      <p>off this rock!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>I don't think so, sir. I'm only a</p>
      <p>droid and not very knowledgeable</p>
      <p>about such things. Not on this planet,</p>
      <p>anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm</p>
      <p>not even sure which planet I'm on.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Well, if there's a bright center to</p>
      <p>the universe, you're on the planet</p>
      <p>that it's farthest from.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>I see, sir.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Uh, you can call me Luke.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>I see, sir Luke.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>(laughing)</p>
      <p>Just Luke.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg</p>
      <p>relations, and this is my counterpart,</p>
      <p>Artoo-Detoo.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Hello.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to</p>
      <p>scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome</p>
      <p>pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping</p>
      <p>oil from his bronze body.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>You got a lot of carbon scoring here.</p>
      <p>It looks like you boys have seen a</p>
      <p>lot of action.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>With all we've been through, sometimes</p>
      <p>I'm amazed we're in as good condition</p>
      <p>as we are, what with the Rebellion</p>
      <p>and all.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>You know of the Rebellion against</p>
      <p>the Empire?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>That's how we came to be in your</p>
      <p>service, if you take my meaning,</p>
      <p>sir.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Have you been in many battles?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Several, I think. Actually, there's</p>
      <p>not much to tell. I'm not much more</p>
      <p>than an interpreter, and not very</p>
      <p>good at telling stories. Well, not</p>
      <p>at making them interesting, anyways.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's</p>
      <p>neck joint. He uses a larger pick.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Well, my little friend, you've got</p>
      <p>something jammed in here real good.</p>
      <p>Were you on a cruiser or...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling</p>
      <p>head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-</p>
      <p>dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being</p>
      <p>projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a</p>
      <p>rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly</p>
      <p>lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my</p>
      <p>only hope.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>What's this?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio</p>
      <p>to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment</p>
      <p>over and over.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>What is what?!? He asked you a</p>
      <p>question...</p>
      <p>(pointing to Leia)</p>
      <p>What is that?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice</p>
      <p>the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer</p>
      <p>for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the</p>
      <p>sentence fragment over and over.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my</p>
      <p>only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.</p>
      <p>You're my only hope.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely</p>
      <p>a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no</p>
      <p>mind.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Who is she? She's beautiful.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>I think she was a passenger on our</p>
      <p>last voyage. A person of some</p>
      <p>importance, sir -- I believe. Our</p>
      <p>captain was attached to...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Is there more to this recording?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic</p>
      <p>squeaks and a whistle.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going</p>
      <p>to get us in trouble. It's all right,</p>
      <p>you can trust him. He's our new</p>
      <p>master.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>He says he's the property of Obi-Wan</p>
      <p>Kenobi, a resident of these parts.</p>
      <p>And it's a private message for him.</p>
      <p>Quite frankly, sir I don't know what</p>
      <p>he's talking about. Our last master</p>
      <p>was Captain Antilles, but with what</p>
      <p>we've been through, this little R2</p>
      <p>unit has become a bit eccentric.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means</p>
      <p>old Ben Kenobi?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>I beg your pardon, sir, but do you</p>
      <p>know what he's talking about?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-</p>
      <p>Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond</p>
      <p>the dune sea. He's kind of a strange</p>
      <p>old hermit.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few</p>
      <p>moments.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>I wonder who she is. It sounds like</p>
      <p>she's in trouble. I'd better play</p>
      <p>back the whole thing.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo beeps something to Threepio.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>He says the restraining bolt has</p>
      <p>short circuited his recording system.</p>
      <p>He suggests that if you remove the</p>
      <p>bolt, he might be able to play back</p>
      <p>the entire recording.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't</p>
      <p>really heard what Threepio has been saying.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're</p>
      <p>too small to run away on me if I</p>
      <p>take this off! Okay.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off</p>
      <p>Artoo's side.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>There you go.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The princess immediately disappears...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go?</p>
      <p>Bring her back! Play back the entire</p>
      <p>message.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in</p>
      <p>embarrassment.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>What message? The one you're carrying</p>
      <p>inside your rusty innards!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A women's voice calls out from another room.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>AUNT BERU</p>
      <p>Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning</p>
      <p>robot.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>All right, I'll be right there, Aunt</p>
      <p>Beru.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to</p>
      <p>have picked up a slight flutter.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and</p>
      <p>hurries out of the room.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Well, see what you can do with him.</p>
      <p>I'll be right back.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>(to Artoo)</p>
      <p>Just you reconsider playing that</p>
      <p>message for him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo beeps in response.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>No, I don't think he likes you at</p>
      <p>all.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo beeps.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>No, I don't like you either.</p>

      <p>INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher</p>
      <p>with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-</p>
      <p>used kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls</p>
      <p>of food and starts for the dining area.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with</p>
      <p>steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red</p>
      <p>grain.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>You know, I think that R2 unit we</p>
      <p>bought might have been stolen.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>What makes you think that?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Well, I stumbled across a recording</p>
      <p>while I was cleaning him. He says he</p>
      <p>belongs to someone called Obi-Wan</p>
      <p>Kenobi.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but</p>
      <p>manages to control himself.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>I thought he might have meant old</p>
      <p>Ben. Do you know what he's talking</p>
      <p>about? Well, I wonder if he's related</p>
      <p>to Ben.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>That old man's just a crazy old</p>
      <p>wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take</p>
      <p>that R2 unit into Anchorhead and</p>
      <p>have its memory flushed. That'll be</p>
      <p>the end of it. It belongs to us now.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking</p>
      <p>for him?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>He won't, I don't think he exists</p>
      <p>any more. He died about the same</p>
      <p>time as your father.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>He knew my father?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>I told you to forget it. Your only</p>
      <p>concern is to prepare the new droids</p>
      <p>for tomorrow. In the morning I want</p>
      <p>them on the south ridge working out</p>
      <p>those condensers.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Yes, sir. I think those new droids</p>
      <p>are going to work out fine. In fact,</p>
      <p>I, uh, was also thinking about our</p>
      <p>agreement about my staying on another</p>
      <p>season. And if these new droids do</p>
      <p>work out, I want to transmit my</p>
      <p>application to the Academy this year.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress</p>
      <p>it.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>You mean the next semester before</p>
      <p>harvest?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Sure, there're more than enough</p>
      <p>droids.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>Harvest is when I need you the most.</p>
      <p>Only one more season. This year we'll</p>
      <p>make enough on the harvest so I'll</p>
      <p>be able to hire some more hands. And</p>
      <p>then you can go to the Academy next</p>
      <p>year.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>You must understand I need you here,</p>
      <p>Luke.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>But it's a whole 'nother year.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>Look, it's only one more season.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Yeah, that's what you said last year</p>
      <p>when Biggs and Tank left.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>AUNT BERU</p>
      <p>Where are you going?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>It looks like I'm going nowhere. I</p>
      <p>have to finish cleaning those droids.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen</p>
      <p>mechanically finishes his dinner.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>AUNT BERU</p>
      <p>Owen, he can't stay here forever.</p>
      <p>Most of his friends have gone. It</p>
      <p>means so much to him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>I'll make it up to him next year. I</p>
      <p>promise.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>AUNT BERU</p>
      <p>Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He</p>
      <p>has too much of his father in him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OWEN</p>
      <p>That's what I'm afraid of.</p>

      <p>The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a</p>
      <p>distant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few</p>
      <p>moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the</p>
      <p>homestead.</p>

      <p>Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in</p>
      <p>sight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt</p>
      <p>similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the</p>
      <p>box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a</p>
      <p>short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>What are you doing hiding there?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in</p>
      <p>sight.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't</p>
      <p>deactivate me. I told him not to go,</p>
      <p>but he's faulty, malfunctioning;</p>
      <p>kept babbling on about his mission.</p>

      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Oh, no!</p>

      <p>electrobinoculars.</p>

      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>That R2 unit has always been a</p>
      <p>problem. These astro-droids are</p>
      <p>getting quite out of hand. Even I</p>
      <p>can't understand their logic at times.</p>

      <p>Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go</p>
      <p>after him?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>It's too dangerous with all the</p>
      <p>Sandpeople around. We'll have to</p>
      <p>wait until morning.</p>

      <p>two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert</p>
      <p>cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the</p>

      <p>as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns,</p>
      <p>and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders</p>

      <p>Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's</p>
      <p>have a look. Come on.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and</p>
      <p>scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the</p>
      <p>two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young</p>
      <p>adventurer.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>There are two Banthas down there but</p>
      <p>I don't see any... wait a second,</p>
      <p>they're Sandpeople all right. I can</p>
      <p>see one of them now.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his</p>
      <p>electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of</p>
      <p>his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large,</p>
      <p>gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled</p>
      <p>and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be</p>
      <p>heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles</p>
      <p>down the side of the mountain.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed</p>
      <p>gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in</p>
      <p>the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block</p>
      <p>the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces.</p>
      <p>The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced</p>
      <p>to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands</p>
      <p>over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible</p>
      <p>shrieking laugh.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in</p>
      <p>the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the</p>
      <p>inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the</p>
      <p>speeder. The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts</p>
      <p>and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then</p>
      <p>everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan</p>
      <p>is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the</p>
      <p>Sandpeople fleeing in terror.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight</p>
      <p>swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even</p>
      <p>closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and</p>
      <p>leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and</p>
      <p>weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating</p>
      <p>eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes</p>
      <p>as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a</p>
      <p>slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Hello there! Come here my little</p>
      <p>friend. Don't be afraid.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and</p>
      <p>begins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand on</p>
      <p>Luke's forehead and he begins to come around.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Don't worry, he'll be all right.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>What happened?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Rest easy, son, you've had a busy</p>
      <p>day. You're fortunate you're still</p>
      <p>in one piece.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to</p>
      <p>see you!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>The Jundland wastes are not to be</p>
      <p>traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke,</p>
      <p>what brings you out this far?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Oh, this little droid! I think he's</p>
      <p>searching for his former master...</p>
      <p>I've never seen such devotion in a</p>
      <p>droid before... there seems to be no</p>
      <p>stopping him. He claims to be the</p>
      <p>property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he</p>
      <p>a relative of yours? Do you know who</p>
      <p>he's talking about?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats</p>
      <p>a name I haven't heard in a long</p>
      <p>time... a long time.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>I think my uncle knew him. He said</p>
      <p>he was dead.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Oh, he's not dead, not... not yet.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>You know him!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Well of course, of course I know</p>
      <p>him. He's me! I haven't gone by the</p>
      <p>name Obi-Wan since oh, before you</p>
      <p>were born.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Then the droid does belong to you.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Don't seem to remember ever owning a</p>
      <p>droid. Very interesting...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>I think we better get indoors. The</p>
      <p>Sandpeople are easily startled but</p>
      <p>they will soon be back and in greater</p>
      <p>numbers.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic</p>
      <p>beep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Threepio!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>EXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins</p>
      <p>to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and</p>
      <p>Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half</p>
      <p>buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then</p>
      <p>flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally</p>
      <p>the mechanical man's systems turn on.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Where am I? I must have taken a bad</p>
      <p>step...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Can you stand? We've got to get out</p>
      <p>of here before the Sandpeople return.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>I don't think I can make it. You go</p>
      <p>on, Master Luke. There's no sense in</p>
      <p>you risking yourself on my account.</p>
      <p>I'm done for.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo makes a beeping sound.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>No, you're not. What kind of talk is</p>
      <p>that?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little</p>
      <p>Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around</p>
      <p>suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the</p>
      <p>air.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Quickly, son... they're on the move.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. KENOBI'S DWELLING</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but</p>
      <p>still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and</p>
      <p>security. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as</p>
      <p>old Ben sits thinking.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>No, my father didn't fight in the</p>
      <p>wars. He was a navigator on a spice</p>
      <p>freighter.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>That's what your uncle told you. He</p>
      <p>didn't hold with your father's ideals.</p>
      <p>Thought he should have stayed here</p>
      <p>and not gotten involved.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>You fought in the Clone Wars?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the</p>
      <p>same as your father.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>I wish I'd known him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>He was the best star-pilot in the</p>
      <p>galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I</p>
      <p>understand you've become quite a</p>
      <p>good pilot yourself. And he was a</p>
      <p>good friend. Which reminds me...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.</p>
      <p>As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the</p>
      <p>restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.</p>
      <p>Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the</p>
      <p>table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle</p>
      <p>with several electronic gadgets attached to it.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>I have something here for you. Your</p>
      <p>father wanted you to have this when</p>
      <p>you were old enough, but your uncle</p>
      <p>wouldn't allow it. He feared you</p>
      <p>might follow old Obi-Wan on some</p>
      <p>damned-fool idealistic crusade like</p>
      <p>your father did.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Sir, if you'll not be needing me,</p>
      <p>I'll close down for awhile.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Sure, go ahead.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Ben hands Luke the saber.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>What is it?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Your fathers lightsaber. This is the</p>
      <p>weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy</p>
      <p>or as random as a blaster.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out</p>
      <p>about four feet and flickers there. The light plays across</p>
      <p>the ceiling.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>An elegant weapon for a more civilized</p>
      <p>time. For over a thousand generations</p>
      <p>the Jedi Knights were the guardians</p>
      <p>of peace and justice in the Old</p>
      <p>Republic. Before the dark times,</p>
      <p>before the Empire.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke hasn't really been listening.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>How did my father die?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who</p>
      <p>was a pupil of mine until he turned</p>
      <p>to evil, helped the Empire hunt down</p>
      <p>and destroy the Jedi Knights. He</p>
      <p>betrayed and murdered your father.</p>
      <p>Now the Jedi are all but extinct.</p>
      <p>Vader was seduced by the dark side</p>
      <p>of the Force.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>The Force?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi</p>
      <p>his power. It's an energy field</p>
      <p>created by all living things. It</p>
      <p>surrounds us and penetrates us. It</p>
      <p>binds the galaxy together.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo makes beeping sounds.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Now, let's see if we can't figure</p>
      <p>out what you are, my little friend.</p>
      <p>And where you come from.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>I saw part of the message he was...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful</p>
      <p>young Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>I seem to have found it.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before</p>
      <p>his eyes.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>General Kenobi, years ago you served</p>
      <p>my father in the Clone Wars. Now he</p>
      <p>begs you to help him in his struggle</p>
      <p>against the Empire. I regret that I</p>
      <p>am unable to present my father's</p>
      <p>request to you in person, but my</p>
      <p>ship has fallen under attack and I'm</p>
      <p>afraid my mission to bring you to</p>
      <p>Alderaan has failed. I have placed</p>
      <p>information vital to the survival of</p>
      <p>the Rebellion into the memory systems</p>
      <p>of this R2 unit. My father will know</p>
      <p>how to retrieve it. You must see</p>
      <p>this droid safely delivered to him</p>
      <p>on Alderaan. This is our most</p>
      <p>desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan</p>
      <p>Kenobi, you're my only hope.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>There is a little static and the transmission is cut short.</p>
      <p>Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs</p>
      <p>on a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>You must learn the ways of the Force</p>
      <p>if you're to come with me to Alderaan.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>(laughing)</p>
      <p>Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan.</p>
      <p>I've got to go home. It's late, I'm</p>
      <p>in for it as it is.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>I need your help, Luke. She needs</p>
      <p>your help. I'm getting too old for</p>
      <p>this sort of thing.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>I can't get involved! I've got work</p>
      <p>to do! It's not that I like the</p>
      <p>Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing</p>
      <p>I can do about it right now. It's</p>
      <p>such a long way from here.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>That's your uncle talking.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>(sighing)</p>
      <p>Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever</p>
      <p>going to explain this?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Learn about the Force, Luke.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Look, I can take you as far as</p>
      <p>Anchorhead. You can get a transport</p>
      <p>there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're</p>
      <p>going.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>You must do what you feel is right,</p>
      <p>of course.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>EXT. SPACE.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>An Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like</p>
      <p>battle station: the Death Star!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black</p>
      <p>conference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around</p>
      <p>the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general,</p>
      <p>is speaking.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>TAGGE</p>
      <p>Until this battle station is fully</p>
      <p>operational we are vulnerable. The</p>
      <p>Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.</p>
      <p>They're more dangerous than you</p>
      <p>realize.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>MOTTI</p>
      <p>Dangerous to your starfleet,</p>
      <p>Commander, not to this battle station!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>TAGGE</p>
      <p>The Rebellion will continue to gain</p>
      <p>a support in the Imperial Senate as</p>
      <p>long as....</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut</p>
      <p>short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial</p>
      <p>outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally,</p>
      <p>The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and</p>
      <p>bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his</p>
      <p>place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind</p>
      <p>him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>TARKIN</p>
      <p>The Imperial Senate will no longer</p>
      <p>be of any concern to us. I've just</p>
      <p>received word that the Emperor has</p>
      <p>dissolved the council permanently.</p>
      <p>The last remnants of the Old Republic</p>
      <p>have been swept away.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>TAGGE</p>
      <p>That's impossible! How will the</p>
      <p>Emperor maintain control without the</p>
      <p>bureaucracy?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>TARKIN</p>
      <p>The regional governors now have direct</p>
      <p>control over territories. Fear will</p>
      <p>keep the local systems in line. Fear</p>
      <p>of this battle station.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>TAGGE</p>
      <p>And what of the Rebellion? If the</p>
      <p>Rebels have obtained a complete</p>
      <p>technical readout of this station,</p>
      <p>it is possible, however unlikely,</p>
      <p>that they might find a weakness and</p>
      <p>exploit it.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>VADER</p>
      <p>The plans you refer to will soon be</p>
      <p>back in our hands.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>MOTTI</p>
      <p>Any attack made by the Rebels against</p>
      <p>this station would be a useless</p>

      <p>den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic</p>
      <p>alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At</p>
      <p>first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy,</p>
      <p>furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over</p>
      <p>drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group</p>
      <p>of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender</p>
      <p>stops Luke and the robots.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BARTENDER</p>
      <p>We don't serve their kind here!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many</p>
      <p>outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's</p>
      <p>drift.</p>

      <p>Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the</p>
      <p>Galactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures</p>
      <p>along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.</p>

      <p>I heartily agree with you sir.</p>

      <p>Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the</p>
      <p>creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage-</p>
      <p>looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with</p>
      <p>fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-</p>
      <p>covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.</p>
      <p>Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers,</p>
      <p>and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a</p>
      <p>sight to behold.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times</p>
      <p>during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets</p>
      <p>out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit</p>
      <p>disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between</p>
      <p>Ben and the giant Wookiee.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips</p>
      <p>his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear</p>
      <p>or whatever.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.</p>

      <p>CREATURE</p>
      <p>Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore</p>
      <p>the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby</p>
      <p>Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the</p>
      <p>belligerent monstrosity.</p>

      <p>HUMAN</p>
      <p>You'll be dead.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar</p>
      <p>moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His</p>
      <p>three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind</p>
      <p>Luke.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>This little one isn't worth the</p>
      <p>effort. Come let me buy you</p>
      <p>something...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young</p>
      <p>would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables</p>
      <p>and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid.</p>
      <p>With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked</p>
      <p>chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben.</p>
      <p>The bartender panics.</p>

      <p>BARTENDER</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life</p>
      <p>and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut</p>
      <p>in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled,</p>
      <p>cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns</p>
      <p>off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt.</p>
      <p>Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities,</p>
      <p>attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter</p>
      <p>of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is</p>
      <p>given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing</p>
      <p>his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben</p>
      <p>points the the Wookiee.</p>

      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Well, that's the trick, isn't it?</p>

      <p>extra. Ten thousand in advance.</p>

      <p>Ten thousand? We could almost buy</p>
      <p>our own ship for that!</p>

      <p>As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien</p>
      <p>with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side. The creature</p>
      <p>speaks in a foreign tongue translated into English subtitles.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>GREEDO</p>
      <p>Going somewhere, Solo?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I</p>
      <p>was just going to see your boss.</p>
      <p>Tell Jabba that I've got his money.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the</p>
      <p>gun on him.</p>

      <p>GREEDO</p>
      <p>It's too late. You should have paid</p>
      <p>him when you had the chance. Jabba's</p>
      <p>put a price on your head, so large</p>

      <p>Yeah, but this time I got the money.</p>

      <p>If you give it to me, I might forget</p>
      <p>I found you.</p>

      <p>I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...</p>

      <p>Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you</p>
      <p>think I had a choice?</p>

      <p>Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>GREEDO</p>
      <p>You can tell that to Jabba. He may</p>
      <p>only take your ship.</p>

      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Over my dead body.</p>

      <p>Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of</p>
      <p>light. Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as</p>
      <p>the other patron look on in bemused amazement. Han gets up</p>
      <p>and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some</p>

      <p>EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The Millennium Falcon pirateship races away from the yellow</p>
      <p>planet, Tatooine. It is followed by two huge Imperial</p>
      <p>stardestroyers.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Over the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the galaxy</p>
      <p>spread before them. Luke and Ben make their way into the</p>
      <p>cramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Stay sharp! There are two more coming</p>
      <p>in; they're going to try to cut us</p>
      <p>off.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Why don't you outrun them? I thought</p>
      <p>you said this thing was fast.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Watch your mouth, kid, or you're</p>
      <p>going to find yourself floating home.</p>
      <p>We'll be safe enough once we make</p>
      <p>the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I</p>
      <p>know a few maneuvers. We'll lose</p>
      <p>them!</p>

      <p>Imperial cruisers fire at the pirateship.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Here's where the fun begins!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>How long before you can make the</p>
      <p>jump to light speed?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>It'll take a few moments to get the</p>
      <p>coordinates from the navi-computer.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Are you kidding? At the rate they're</p>
      <p>gaining...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Traveling through hyperspace isn't</p>
      <p>like dusting crops, boy! Without</p>
      <p>precise calculations we could fly</p>
      <p>right through a star or bounce too</p>
      <p>close to a supernova and that'd end</p>
      <p>your trip real quick, wouldn't it?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red</p>
      <p>warning light begins to flash.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>What's that flashing?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>We're losing our deflector shield.</p>
      <p>Go strap yourself in, I'm going to</p>
      <p>make the jump to light speed.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if</p>
      <p>crashing a barrier. Stars become streaks as the pirateship</p>
      <p>makes the jump to hyperspace.</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>Admiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before</p>
      <p>Governor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen</p>
      <p>displaying a small green planet.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>MOTTI</p>
      <p>We've entered the Alderaan system.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Vader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia. Her</p>
      <p>hands are bound.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>Governor Tarkin, I should have</p>
      <p>expected to find you holding Vader's</p>
      <p>leash. I recognized your foul stench</p>
      <p>when I was brought on board.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>TARKIN</p>
      <p>Charming to the last. You don't know</p>
      <p>how hard I found it signing the order</p>
      <p>to terminate your life!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>I surprised you had the courage to</p>
      <p>take the responsibility yourself!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>TARKIN</p>
      <p>Princess Leia, before your execution</p>
      <p>I would like you to be my guest at a</p>
      <p>ceremony that will make this battle</p>
      <p>station operational. No star system</p>
      <p>will dare oppose the Emperor now.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>The more you tighten your grip,</p>
      <p>Tarkin, the more star systems will</p>
      <p>slip through your fingers.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>TARKIN</p>
      <p>Not after we demonstrate the power</p>
      <p>of this station. In a way, you have</p>
      <p>determined the choice of the planet</p>
      <p>that'll be destroyed first. Since</p>
      <p>you are reluctant to provide us with</p>
      <p>the location of the Rebel base, I</p>
      <p>have chosen to test this station's</p>
      <p>destructive power... on your home</p>
      <p>planet of Alderaan.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no</p>
      <p>weapons. You can't possibly...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>TARKIN</p>
      <p>You would prefer another target? A</p>
      <p>military target? Then name the system!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>TARKIN</p>
      <p>I grow tired of asking this. So it'll</p>
      <p>be the last time. Where is the Rebel</p>
      <p>base?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to</p>
      <p>Alderaan.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>(softly)</p>
      <p>Dantooine.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Leia lowers her head.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>They're on Dantooine.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>TARKIN</p>
      <p>There. You see Lord Vader, she can</p>
      <p>be reasonable.</p>
      <p>(addressing Motti)</p>
      <p>Continue with the operation. You may</p>
      <p>fire when ready.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>What?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>TARKIN</p>
      <p>You're far too trusting. Dantooine</p>
      <p>is too remote to make an effective</p>
      <p>demonstration. But don't worry. We</p>
      <p>will deal with your Rebel friends</p>
      <p>soon enough.</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A</p>
      <p>hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever.</p>
      <p>Another lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still another</p>
      <p>lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. A</p>
      <p>huge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area</p>
      <p>and converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan.</p>
      <p>The small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust.</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small "seeker"</p>
      <p>robot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He falters,</p>
      <p>seems almost faint.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Are you all right? What's wrong?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>I felt a great disturbance in the</p>
      <p>Force... as if millions of voices</p>
      <p>suddenly cried out in terror and</p>
      <p>were suddenly silenced. I fear</p>
      <p>something terrible has happened.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then</p>
      <p>he fixes his gaze on Luke.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>You'd better get on with your</p>
      <p>exercises.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Han Solo enters the room.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Well, you can forget your troubles</p>
      <p>with those Imperial slugs. I told</p>
      <p>you I'd outrun 'em.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Don't everyone thank me at once.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a</p>
      <p>game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move</p>
      <p>along a chess-type board.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Anyway, we should be at Alderaan</p>
      <p>about oh-two-hundred hours.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table</p>
      <p>covered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the</p>
      <p>table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca</p>
      <p>seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur-</p>
      <p>covered arms over his head.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Now be careful, Artoo.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his</p>
      <p>stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures</p>
      <p>to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's</p>
      <p>face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot.</p>
      <p>Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and</p>
      <p>begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>He made a fair move. Screaming about</p>
      <p>it won't help you.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>(interrupting)</p>
      <p>Let him have it. It's not wise to</p>
      <p>upset a Wookiee.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>But sir, nobody worries about</p>
      <p>upsetting a droid.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>That's 'cause droids don't pull</p>
      <p>people's arms out of their socket</p>
      <p>when they lose. Wookiees are known</p>
      <p>to do that.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>I see your point, sir. I suggest a</p>
      <p>new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee</p>
      <p>win.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems</p>
      <p>frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his</p>
      <p>head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements.</p>
      <p>Han watches with a bit of smugness.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force</p>
      <p>flowing through him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>You mean it controls your actions?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Partially. But it also obeys your</p>
      <p>commands.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a</p>
      <p>"seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae,</p>
      <p>hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of</p>
      <p>the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift</p>
      <p>lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't</p>
      <p>move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy,</p>
      <p>then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood</p>
      <p>red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing</p>
      <p>him to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Hokey religions and ancient weapons</p>
      <p>are no match for a good blaster at</p>
      <p>your side, kid.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>You don't believe in the Force, do</p>
      <p>you?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Kid, I've flown from one side of</p>
      <p>this galaxy to the other. I've seen</p>
      <p>a lot of strange stuff, but I've</p>
      <p>never seen anything to make me believe</p>
      <p>there's one all-powerful force</p>
      <p>controlling everything. There's no</p>
      <p>mystical energy field that controls</p>
      <p>my destiny.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Ben smiles quietly.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>It's all a lot of simple tricks and</p>
      <p>nonsense.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>I suggest you try it again, Luke.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his</p>
      <p>eyes.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>This time, let go your conscious</p>
      <p>self and act on instinct.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>(laughing)</p>
      <p>With the blast shield down, I can't</p>
      <p>even see. How am I supposed to fight?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Your eyes can deceive you. Don't</p>
      <p>trust them.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker</p>
      <p>into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then</p>
      <p>drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly</p>
      <p>missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits</p>
      <p>Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful</p>
      <p>yell and attempts to hit the seeker.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Stretch out with your feelings.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes</p>
      <p>a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the</p>
      <p>bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original</p>
      <p>position.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>You see, you can do it.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>I call it luck.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>In my experience, there's no such</p>
      <p>thing as luck.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Look, going good against remotes is</p>
      <p>one thing. Going good against the</p>
      <p>living? That's something else.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the</p>
      <p>control panel.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Looks like we're coming up on</p>
      <p>Alderaan.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>You know, I did feel something. I</p>
      <p>could almost see the remote.</p>

      <p>stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then</p>
      <p>stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently</p>

      <p>What do you mean? Where is it?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Thats what I'm trying to tell you,</p>
      <p>kid. It ain't there. It's been totally</p>
      <p>blown away.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>What? How?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to</p>
      <p>settle down.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Destroyed... by the Empire!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>The entire starfleet couldn't destroy</p>
      <p>the whole planet. It'd take a thousand</p>
      <p>ships with more fire power than</p>
      <p>I've...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled</p>
      <p>alarm starts humming.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>There's another ship coming in.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Maybe they know what happened.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>It's an Imperial fighter.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Chewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside</p>
      <p>the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny, finned</p>
      <p>Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>It followed us!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>No. It's a short range fighter.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>There aren't any bases around here.</p>
      <p>Where did it come from?</p>

      <p>If they identify us, we're in big</p>
      <p>trouble.</p>

      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam</p>
      <p>it's transmissions.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>It'd be as well to let it go. It's</p>
      <p>too far out of range.</p>

      <p>The pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the</p>

      <p>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny</p>
      <p>fighter. In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter</p>
      <p>until it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it. Ben</p>
      <p>stands behind Chewbacca.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>A fighter that size couldn't get</p>
      <p>this deep into space on its own.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>It must have gotten lost, been part</p>
      <p>of a convoy or something.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Well, he ain't going to be around</p>
      <p>long enough to tell anyone about us.</p>

      <p>The TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as</p>
      <p>they race toward camera and disappear over head.</p>

      <p>The distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or</p>
      <p>planet.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Look at him. He's headed for that</p>
      <p>small moon.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>I think I can get him before he gets</p>
      <p>there... he's almost in range.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous</p>
      <p>spherical battle station.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>That's no moon! It's a space station.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>It's too big to be a space station.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>I have a very bad feeling about this.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Yeah, I think your right. Full</p>
      <p>reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary</p>
      <p>power.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away</p>
      <p>toward the gargantuan battle station.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Why are we still moving towards it?</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>There's nothin' I can do about it,</p>
      <p>kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to</p>
      <p>have to shut down. But they're not</p>
      <p>going to get me without a fight!</p>

      <p>As the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome</p>
      <p>metal moon, the immense size of the massive battle station</p>

      <p>The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound</p>

      <p>Hey down there, could you give us a</p>
      <p>hand with this?</p>

      <p>INT. DEATH STAR - FORWARD BAY - COMMAND OFFICE</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>In a very small command office near the entrance to the</p>
      <p>pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices</p>
      <p>the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>GANTRY OFFICER</p>
      <p>TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at</p>
      <p>your post? TX-four-one-two, do you</p>
      <p>copy?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and</p>
      <p>waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating</p>
      <p>his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his</p>
      <p>head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an</p>
      <p>annoyed look.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>GANTRY OFFICER</p>
      <p>Take over. We've got a bad</p>
      <p>transmitter. I'll see what I can do.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing</p>
      <p>the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary</p>
      <p>state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling</p>
      <p>howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow.</p>
      <p>The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted</p>
      <p>by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the</p>
      <p>robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed</p>
      <p>as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>You know, between his howling and</p>
      <p>your blasting everything in sight,</p>
      <p>it's a wonder the whole station</p>
      <p>doesn't know we're here.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Bring them on! I prefer a straight</p>
      <p>fight to all this sneaking around.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>We found the computer outlet, sir.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of</p>
      <p>the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it</p>
      <p>carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.</p>
      <p>Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Plug in. He should be able to</p>
      <p>interpret the entire Imperial computer</p>
      <p>network.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the</p>
      <p>vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information</p>
      <p>to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>He says he's found the main computer</p>
      <p>to power the tractor beam that's</p>
      <p>holding the ship here. He'll try to</p>
      <p>make the precise location appear on</p>
      <p>the monitor.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The computer monitor flashes readouts.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>The tractor beam is coupled to the</p>
      <p>main reactor in seven locations. A</p>
      <p>power loss at one of the terminals</p>
      <p>will allow the ship to leave.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>I don't think you boys can help. I</p>
      <p>must go alone.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Whatever you say. I've done more</p>
      <p>that I bargained for on this trip</p>
      <p>already.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>I want to go with you.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch</p>
      <p>over the droids.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>But he can...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>They must be delivered safely or</p>
      <p>other star systems will suffer the</p>
      <p>same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny</p>
      <p>lies along a different path than</p>
      <p>mine. The Force will be with you...</p>
      <p>always!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps</p>
      <p>out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey</p>
      <p>hallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head</p>
      <p>in agreement.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Boy you said it, Chewie.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Han looks at Luke.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Where did you dig up that old fossil?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Ben is a great man.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Yeah, great at getting us into</p>
      <p>trouble.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>I didn't hear you give any ideas...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Well, anything would be better than</p>
      <p>just hanging around waiting for him</p>
      <p>to pick us up...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Who do you think...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.</p>
      <p>Luke goes over to him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>What is it?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.</p>
      <p>He says "I found her", and keeps</p>
      <p>repeating, "She's here."</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Well, who... who has he found?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo whistles a frantic reply.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Princess Leia.</p>

      <p>The princess? She's here?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Princess? What's going on?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-</p>
      <p>three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to</p>
      <p>be terminated.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Oh, no! We've got to do something.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>What are you talking about?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>The droid belongs to her. She's the</p>
      <p>one in the message... We've got to</p>
      <p>help her.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.</p>
      <p>The old man wants us to wait right</p>
      <p>here.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>But he didn't know she was here.</p>
      <p>Look, will you just find a way back</p>
      <p>into the detention block?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>I'm not going anywhere.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>They're going to execute her. Look,</p>
      <p>a few minutes ago you said you didn't</p>
      <p>want to just wait here to be captured.</p>
      <p>Now all you want to do is stay.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Marching into the detention area is</p>
      <p>not what I had in mind.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>But they're going to kill her!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Better her than me...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>She's rich.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Chewbacca growls.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Rich?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you</p>
      <p>were to rescue her, the reward would</p>
      <p>be...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>What?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Well more wealth that you can imagine.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>I don't know, I can imagine quite a</p>
      <p>bit!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>You'll get it!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>I better!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>You will...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>All right, kid. But you'd better be</p>
      <p>right about this.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>All right.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>What's your plan?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders</p>
      <p>there will you?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on</p>
      <p>you.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Chewie lets out a hideous growl.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Okay. Han, you put these on.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know</p>
      <p>what he has in mind.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as</p>
      <p>Han binds him with the electronic cuffs.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for</p>
      <p>asking... but, ah... what should</p>
      <p>Artoo and I do if we're discovered</p>
      <p>here?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Lock the door!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>And hope they don't have blasters.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>That isn't very reassuring.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and</p>
      <p>start off into the giant Imperial Death Star.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits</p>
      <p>as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops,</p>
      <p>bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio</p>
      <p>completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious</p>
      <p>glance.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>I can't see a thing in this helmet.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away</p>
      <p>by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and</p>
      <p>the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main</p>
      <p>passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot</p>
      <p>similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end</p>
      <p>of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then</p>
      <p>disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting</p>
      <p>that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion.</p>
      <p>No one in the hallway seems to notice him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY</p>
      <p>AREA</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door</p>
      <p>slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards</p>
      <p>enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates</p>
      <p>are everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>This is not going to work.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Why didn't you say so before?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>I did say so before!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. DETENTION AREA</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches</p>
      <p>the trio.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OFFICER</p>
      <p>Where are you taking this... thing?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut</p>
      <p>up.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-</p>
      <p>three-eight.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>OFFICER</p>
      <p>I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear</p>
      <p>it.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in</p>
      <p>the information. There are only three other troopers in the</p>
      <p>area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the</p>
      <p>alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of</p>
      <p>Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one</p>
      <p>of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Look out! He's loose!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>He's going to pull us all apart.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Go get him!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and</p>
      <p>Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are</p>
      <p>blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of</p>
      <p>laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser</p>
      <p>gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the</p>
      <p>last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is</p>
      <p>about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink</p>
      <p>system, which is screeching questions about what is going</p>
      <p>on. He quickly checks the computer readout.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>We've got to find out which cell</p>
      <p>this princess of yours is in. Here</p>
      <p>it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven.</p>
      <p>You go get her. I'll hold them here.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into</p>
      <p>the buzzing comlink.</p>

      <p>Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor</p>

      <p></p>

      <p>Boring conversation anyway.</p>
      <p>(yelling down the</p>
      <p>hall)</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>INT. DEATH STAR - CELL ROW</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door</p>
      <p>away with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees</p>
      <p>the dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping</p>
      <p>and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on</p>
      <p>her face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands</p>
      <p>staring at her with his mouth hanging open.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>(finally)</p>
      <p>Aren't you a little short to be a</p>
      <p>stormtrooper?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke</p>
      <p>Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.</p>

      <p>Han and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke</p>

      <p>She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca</p>
      <p>look on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and</p>
      <p>says something.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Get in there you big furry oaf! I</p>
      <p>don't care what you smell! Get in</p>
      <p>there and don't worry about it.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the</p>
      <p>tiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their</p>
      <p>way toward the opening.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to</p>
      <p>kill her or I'm beginning to like</p>
      <p>her. Get in there!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires</p>
      <p>off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then</p>
      <p>slides into the chute himself and is gone.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck.</p>
      <p>Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He</p>
      <p>finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won't</p>
      <p>budge.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>(sarcastically)</p>
      <p>Oh! The garbage chute was a really</p>
      <p>wonderful idea. What an incredible</p>
      <p>smell you've discovered! Let's get</p>
      <p>out of here! Get away from there...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>No! wait!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The</p>
      <p>laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.</p>
      <p>Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes</p>
      <p>almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a</p>
      <p>rather grim look on her face.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Will you forget it? I already tried</p>
      <p>it. It's magnetically sealed!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>Put that thing away! You're going to</p>
      <p>get us all killed.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I</p>
      <p>had everything under control until</p>
      <p>you led us down here. You know, it's</p>
      <p>not going to take them long to figure</p>
      <p>out what happened to us.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>It could be worse...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the</p>
      <p>murky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins</p>
      <p>to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols</p>
      <p>drawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>It's worse.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>There's something alive in here!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>That's your imagination.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Something just moves past my leg!</p>
      <p>Look! Did you see that?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>What?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Help!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Luke! Luke! Luke!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Solo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air</p>
      <p>and thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around</p>
      <p>his throat.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>Luke!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Leia extends a long pipe toward him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Where?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Anywhere! Oh!!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the</p>
      <p>muck by the slimy tentacle.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Luke! Luke!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and</p>
      <p>move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet.</p>
      <p>Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca</p>
      <p>howls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke</p>
      <p>suddenly bobs to the surface.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>Grab him!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke seems to be released by the thing.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>What happened?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>I don't know, it just let go of me</p>
      <p>and disappeared...</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>I've got a very bad feeling about</p>
      <p>this.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and</p>
      <p>edge toward the Rebels.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>The walls are moving!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>Don't just stand there. Try to brace</p>
      <p>it with something.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>They place poles and long metal beams between the closing</p>
      <p>walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant</p>
      <p>trashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too good.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Wait a minute!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke pulls out his comlink.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio!</p>
      <p>Where could he be?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN GANTRY - COMMAND OFFICE</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for</p>
      <p>See-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which</p>
      <p>is sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and</p>
      <p>Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great</p>
      <p>explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the</p>
      <p>floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>FIRST TROOPER</p>
      <p>Take over!</p>
      <p>(pointing to the dead</p>
      <p>officer)</p>
      <p>See to him! Look there!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides</p>
      <p>open. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows</p>
      <p>his bronze companion out into the office.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>They're madmen! They're heading for</p>
      <p>the prison level. If you hurry, you</p>
      <p>might catch them.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>FIRST OFFICER</p>
      <p>(to his troops)</p>
      <p>Follow me! You stand guard.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to</p>
      <p>watch over the command office.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>(to Artoo)</p>
      <p>Come on!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The guard aims a blaster at them.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Oh! All this excitement has overrun</p>
      <p>the circuits of my counterpart here.</p>
      <p>If you don't mind, I'd like to take</p>
      <p>him down to maintenance.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>TROOPER</p>
      <p>All right.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries</p>
      <p>out the door.</p>

      <p>Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his</p>
      <p>giant paws.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is</p>
      <p>snapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.</p>

      <p>Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall</p>

      <p>other. Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she holds</p>
      <p>it tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels</p>

      <p>The clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard.</p>
      <p>The old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading</p>

      <p>Do you know what's going on?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>SECOND TROOPER</p>
      <p>Maybe it's another drill.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers</p>
      <p>as they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his hand</p>
      <p>toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the</p>
      <p>other hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips</p>
      <p>past the troopers and into the main hallway.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>SECOND TROOPER</p>
      <p>What was that?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>FIRST TROOPER</p>
      <p>Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about</p>
      <p>it.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and</p>
      <p>stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers</p>
      <p>are milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>(looking at his ship)</p>
      <p>There she is.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>See-Threepio, do you copy?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>(voice)</p>
      <p>For the moment. Uh, we're in the</p>
      <p>main hangar across from the ship.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>We're right above you. Stand by.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of</p>
      <p>the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and</p>
      <p>points out the window to the ship.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>You came in that thing? You're braver</p>
      <p>that I thought.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Nice! Come on!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the</p>
      <p>hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty</p>
      <p>Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are</p>
      <p>taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>FIRST TROOPER</p>
      <p>It's them! Blast them!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges</p>
      <p>the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the</p>
      <p>stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down</p>
      <p>the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>(to Luke and Leia)</p>
      <p>Get back to the ship!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Where are you going? Come back!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>He certainly has courage.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>What good will it do us if he gets</p>
      <p>himself killed? Come on!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for</p>
      <p>muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke</p>
      <p>and Leia start off toward the starship hangar.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is</p>
      <p>yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a</p>
      <p>dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few</p>
      <p>feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops</p>
      <p>begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are</p>
      <p>moving into an attack position in front of the lone</p>
      <p>starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops</p>
      <p>begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt</p>
      <p>to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of</p>
      <p>laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate</p>
      <p>extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of</p>
      <p>furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running</p>
      <p>the other way also.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down</p>
      <p>a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They</p>
      <p>quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an</p>
      <p>open hatchway.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>INT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge</p>
      <p>that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity.</p>
      <p>The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft,</p>
      <p>and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance</p>
      <p>off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of</p>
      <p>his arm and pulls him back.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>(gasping)</p>
      <p>I think we took a wrong turn.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby</p>
      <p>reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at</p>
      <p>the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch</p>
      <p>that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving</p>
      <p>them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.</p>
      <p>Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>There's no lock!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>That oughta hold it for a while.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>Quick, we've got to get across. Find</p>
      <p>the control that extends the bridge.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Oh, I think I just blasted it.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the</p>
      <p>stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making</p>
      <p>ominous drilling and pounding sounds.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>They're coming through!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when</p>
      <p>laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol</p>
      <p>at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across</p>
      <p>the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops</p>
      <p>appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit,</p>
      <p>and grabs at his chest.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by</p>
      <p>Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move</p>
      <p>back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Here, hold this.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt.</p>
      <p>It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge</p>
      <p>overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the</p>
      <p>rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears</p>
      <p>and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet</p>
      <p>of more troops.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>Here they come!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and</p>
      <p>he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the</p>
      <p>gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He</p>
      <p>tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the</p>
      <p>princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him</p>
      <p>quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LEIA</p>
      <p>For luck!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss</p>
      <p>to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as</p>
      <p>Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the</p>
      <p>stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at</p>
      <p>the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into</p>
      <p>the tiny subhallway.</p>

      <p>INT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several</p>
      <p>stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks</p>
      <p>to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the</p>
      <p>opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of</p>
      <p>the hallway and starts after the old Jedi.</p>

      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Where could they be?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left</p>

      <p>TROOPER</p>
      <p>Close the blast doors!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in</p>
      <p>front of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion</p>
      <p>race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage</p>
      <p>to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops</p>
      <p>before the doors slam shut.</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar</p>
      <p>where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar,</p>
      <p>Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not</p>
      <p>ten feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his</p>
      <p>and steps slowly forward.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>VADER</p>
      <p>I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.</p>
      <p>We meet again, at last. The circle</p>
      <p>is now complete.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive</p>
      <p>position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>VADER</p>
      <p>When I left you, I was but the</p>
      <p>learner; now I am the master.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>Only a master of evil, Darth.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few</p>
      <p>moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right</p>
      <p>moment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain,</p>
      <p>as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He</p>
      <p>shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked</p>
      <p>by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke</p>
      <p>by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's</p>
      <p>blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark</p>
      <p>Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar.</p>
      <p>The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments</p>
      <p>with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing</p>
      <p>sound.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>VADER</p>
      <p>Your powers are weak, old man.</p>

      <p>BEN</p>
      <p>You can't win, Darth. If you strike</p>
      <p>me down, I shall become more powerful</p>
      <p>than you can possibly imagine.</p>

      <p>Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord</p>

      <p>Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who</p>

      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>Now's our chance! Go!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>They start for the Millennium Falcon. Ben sees the troops</p>
      <p>charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader</p>
      <p>takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings</p>
      <p>his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to</p>
      <p>deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts</p>
      <p>his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene</p>
      <p>look on his face.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's</p>
      <p>cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.</p>
      <p>Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the</p>
      <p>empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers</p>
      <p>and the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two</p>
      <p>and starts for him. Aghast, he yells out.</p>

      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>No!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him.</p>
      <p>The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium</p>
      <p>Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns</p>
      <p>their fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and</p>
      <p>advances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.</p>

      <p>Luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it</p>
      <p>explodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge</p>
      <p>forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close</p>
      <p>behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the</p>
      <p>docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his</p>
      <p>onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops,</p>
      <p>as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He</p>
      <p>fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor.</p>

      <p>Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia</p>
      <p>and several other senators are to one side of the giant</p>
      <p>readout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots,</p>
      <p>navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is</p>
      <p>listening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and</p>
      <p>Chewbacca are standing near the back.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>DODONNA</p>
      <p>The battle station is heavily shielded</p>
      <p>and carries a firepower greater than</p>
      <p>half the star fleet. It's defenses</p>
      <p>are designed around a direct large-</p>
      <p>scale assault. A small one-man fighter</p>
      <p>should be able to penetrate the outer</p>
      <p>defense.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands</p>
      <p>and addresses Dodonna.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>GOLD LEADER</p>
      <p>Pardon me for asking, sir, but what</p>
      <p>good are snub fighters going to be</p>
      <p>against that?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>DODONNA</p>
      <p>Well, the Empire doesn't consider a</p>
      <p>small one-man fighter to be any</p>
      <p>threat, or they'd have a tighter</p>
      <p>defense. An analysis of the plans</p>
      <p>provided by Princess Leia has</p>
      <p>demonstrated a weakness in the battle</p>
      <p>station.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping</p>
      <p>sounds, and turns his head from right to left.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>DODONNA</p>
      <p>The approach will not be easy. You</p>
      <p>are required to maneuver straight</p>
      <p>down this trench and skim the surface</p>
      <p>to this point. The target area is</p>
      <p>only two meters wide. It's a small</p>
      <p>thermal exhaust port, right below</p>
      <p>the main port. The shaft leads</p>
      <p>directly to the reactor system. A</p>
      <p>precise hit will start a chain</p>
      <p>reaction which should destroy the</p>
      <p>station.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A murmer of disbelief runs through the room.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>DODONNA</p>
      <p>Only a precise hit will set up a</p>
      <p>chain reaction. The shaft is ray-</p>
      <p>shielded, so you'll have to use proton</p>

      <p>Flight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and</p>
      <p>unlocking power couplings. In an area isolated from this</p>

      <p>That's right, yeah! I got some old</p>
      <p>debts I've got to pay off with this</p>
      <p>stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't</p>
      <p>think I'd be fool enough to stick</p>
      <p>around here, do you? Why don't you</p>
      <p>come with us? You're pretty good in</p>

      <p>Come on! Why don't you take a look</p>
      <p>around? You know what's about to</p>
      <p>happen, what they're up against.</p>
      <p>They could use a good pilot like</p>
      <p>you. You're turning your back on</p>
      <p>them.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>HAN</p>
      <p>What good's a reward if you ain't</p>
      <p>around to use it? Besides, attacking</p>
      <p>that battle station ain't my idea of</p>

      <p>heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs</p>
      <p>his arm.</p>

      <p>Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in</p>
      <p>the outer rim territories.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of</p>
      <p>his fighter.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>RED LEADER</p>
      <p>I met your father once when I was</p>
      <p>just a boy, he was a great pilot.</p>
      <p>You'll do all right. If you've got</p>
      <p>half of your father's skill, you'll</p>
      <p>do better than all right.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Thank you, sir. I'll try.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Red Leader hurries to his own ship.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BIGGS</p>
      <p>I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll</p>
      <p>tell me your stories when we come</p>
      <p>back. All right?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>BIGGS</p>
      <p>(going off)</p>
      <p>You did, all right. It's going to be</p>
      <p>like old times, Luke. We're a couple</p>
      <p>of shooting stars that'll never be</p>
      <p>stopped!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for</p>
      <p>his ship.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly</p>
      <p>spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points</p>
      <p>to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the</p>
      <p>back of the fighter.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>CHIEF</p>
      <p>This R2 unit of your seems a bit</p>
      <p>beat up. Do you want a new one?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>LUKE</p>
      <p>Not on your life! That little droid</p>
      <p>and I have been through a lot</p>
      <p>together.</p>
      <p>(to Artoo)</p>
      <p>You okay, Artoo?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of</p>
      <p>the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps</p>
      <p>that he is fine.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an</p>
      <p>his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive</p>
      <p>hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner</p>
      <p>into Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo</p>
      <p>beeps good-bye.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>CHIEF</p>
      <p>Okay, easy she goes!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to</p>
      <p>come back.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo beeps in agreement.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>THREEPIO</p>
      <p>You wouldn't want my life to get</p>
      <p>boring, would you?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Artoo whistles his reply.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.</p>
      <p>The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the</p>
      <p>pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The</p>
      <p>hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted</p>
      <p>voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses</p>
      <p>are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit</p>
      <p>shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman,</p>
      <p>holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace</p>
      <p>of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.</p>
      <p></p>
