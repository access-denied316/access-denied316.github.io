    <p>Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 5: How To Get FREE Skins And V-Bucks In Battle Royale 
<p>Fortnite Chapter 2 changed the game, including a fresh map and new gameplay features alongside the expected batch of new skins and cosmetics. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you're new to Fortnite or just looking for new threads for your character, you'll be pleased to know that there are numerous ways to get new skins for free. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not only that, but you can earn free V-Bucks to help fund your new skins from the shop! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So with Chapter 2 Season 5 now live, you might want to grab some new cosmetics. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’ve put together the following guide to help you snap up all there is on offer – for free. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here's how to get free V-Bucks and Skins in Fortnite. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Starter Pack </p>
<p>The Starter Pack rewards players with 200 V-Bucks as part of the mega drop sale! </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fortnite Crew </p>
<p>Fortnite's new way to spend in-game is offering players free skins and V-Bucks for $11.99/€11.99. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every month, you’ll receive 1,000 V-Bucks as part of your Fortnite Crew subscription! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is in addition to the V-Bucks you can unlock with your included Battle Pass access. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>That's right, you'll also unlock the Battle Pass for free. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also as part of Fortnite Crew, you’ll get a monthly Fortnite Crew Pack, an exclusive bundle of a new Outfit plus at least one new matching accessory (like a Glider, Pickaxe, or Emote). </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Twitch Prime </p>
<p>If you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber, you have access to Twitch Prime. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you’re wondering what that means for Fortnite, it’s simple – the service offers plenty of goodies for the game, including gliders, skins and more. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Keep an eye on Twitch Prime, too, as they’ll often add items without warning. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Battle Pass </p>
<p>This season there is 300 V-Bucks available for the free Battle Pass! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can earn up to 1000 V-Bucks if you buy the Battle Pass AND you’ll have plenty of skins alongside enough V-Bucks to be able to buy the new battle pass. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Invest now, save later, and keep getting fresh customisation options just for playing the games. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fortnite World Cup/FNCS </p>
<p>At last year's event, attendees were offered FREE V-Bucks for attending the event! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you're looking for a quick cash injection, this is an easy way to get it done although it doesn't look like it is happening this year. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alternatively, the FNCS (Fortnite Championship Series) offers drops and rewards for those that watch the streams. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Limited-Time Events And Cups </p>
<p>Fortnite’s limited-time events are legendary, offering exciting new ways to play alongside coveted new skins. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are often free skins doled out for logging in on such occasions, like the Winterfest 2019 event that offered fourteen gifts and extra challenges. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Recently, the Operation Snowdown event gave players a flurry of new emotes, skins, wraps and other cosmetics such as the Snowmando and Frost Squad skins. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Players that participated in the Fortnite Community Battles also had the chance to win V-Bucks for placing in the top 20,000. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>With Christmas coming up, we're expecting some more events that will allow you to earn new cosmetics. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>PlayStation Plus </p>
<p>Ok, this one is just for the PlayStation gamers, but Sony is offering a free Celebration Pack if you’re a PlayStation Plus subscriber. </p>
<p> </p>
