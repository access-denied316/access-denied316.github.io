        <h1>The Dangers of Dihydrogen monoxide.</h1>
        <p>
          Dihydrogen monoxide is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and kills
          uncounted thousands of people every year. Most of these deaths are
          caused by accidental inhalation of DHMO, but the dangers of dihydrogen
          monoxide do not end there. Prolonged exposure to its solid form causes
          severe tissue damage. Symptoms of DHMO ingestion can include excessive
          sweating and urination, and possibly a bloated feeling, nausea,
          vomiting and body electrolyte imbalance. For those who have become
          dependent, DHMO withdrawal means certain death.
        </p>
        <h2>Quick Facts about Dihydrogen monoxide</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>It is a major component in acid rain.</li>
          <li>Also known as hydroxyl acid</li>
          <li>Contributes to the greenhouse effect</li>
          <li>Can cause severe burns</li>
          <li>Contributes to the erosion of the natural landscape</li>
          <li>Accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals</li>
          <li>Can cause electrical failures</li>
          <li>Able to decrease the effectiveness of automotive brakes</li>
          <li>Has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Despite the clear danger, DHMO is still widely used</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>As an industrial solvent and coolant</li>
          <li>In nuclear powerplants</li>
          <li>In the production of styrofoam</li>
          <li>As a fire retardant</li>
          <li>In many forms of cruel animal research</li>
          <li>
            In the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce still
            can be contaminated by this chemical.
          </li>
          <li>
            As an additive in certain "junk-foods" and other food products
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>So what makes DHMO so dangerous?</h2>
        <p>
          One of the biggest dangers with DHMO is that it completes two of the
          three sides of the combustion triangle.
