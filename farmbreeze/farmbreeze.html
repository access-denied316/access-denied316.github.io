    <h1>ABOUT THIS GAME</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>Farm Breeze is an open-ended country-life RPG!</p>

    <p>
      You've inherited your grandfather's old farm plot in Farm Breeze. Armed
      with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new
      life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields
      into a thriving home? It won't be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came
      to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community
      center, once the town's most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in
      shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little
      dedication, you might just be the one to restore Farm Breeze to greatness!
    </p>
    <p>Features</p>
    <p>
      Turn your overgrown field into a lively farm! Raise animals, grow crops,
      start an orchard, craft useful machines, and more! You'll have plenty of
      space to create the farm of your dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      4 Player Farming! Invite 1-3 players to join you in the valley online!
      Players can work together to build a thriving farm, share resources, and
      improve the local community. As more hands are better than one, players
      have the option to scale profit margin on produce sold for a more
      challenging experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Improve your skills over time. As you make your way from a struggling
      greenhorn to a master farmer, you'll level up in 5 different areas:
      farming, mining, combat, fishing, and foraging. As you progress, you'll
      learn new cooking and crafting recipes, unlock new areas to explore, and
      customize your skills by choosing from a variety of professions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Become part of the local community. With over 30 unique characters living
      in Farm Breeze, you won't have a problem finding new friends! Each person
      has their own daily schedule, birthday, unique mini-cutscenes, and new
      things to say throughout the week and year. As you make friends with them,
      they will open up to you, ask you for help with their personal troubles,
      or tell you their secrets! Take part in seasonal festivals such as the
      luau, haunted maze, and feast of the winter star.
    </p>
    <p>
      Explore a vast, mysterious cave. As you travel deeper underground, you'll
      encounter new and dangerous monsters, powerful weapons, new environments,
      valuable gemstones, raw materials for crafting and upgrading tools, and
      mysteries to be uncovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breathe new life into the valley. Since JojaMart opened, the old way of
      life in Farm Breeze has changed. Much of the town's infrastructure has
      fallen into disrepair. Help restore Farm Breeze to it's former glory by
      repairing the old community center, or take the alternate route and join
      forces with Joja Corporation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Court and marry a partner to share your life on the farm with. There are
      12 available bachelors and bachelorettes to woo, each with unique
      character progression cutscenes. Once married, your partner will live on
      the farm with you. Who knows, maybe you'll have kids and start a family?
    </p>

      Spend a relaxing afternoon at one of the local fishing spots. The waters

      skills, running speed, or combat prowess. Craft useful objects like
      scarecrows, oil makers, furnaces, or even the rare and expensive
      crystalarium.
