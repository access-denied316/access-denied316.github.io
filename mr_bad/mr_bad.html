          <p>
            Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most
            significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Through stage and
            video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as
            the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, and the robot. His sound
            and style have influenced artists of various genres, and his
            contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his
            publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular
            culture for over four decades. Jackson is the most awarded artist in
            the history of popular music.
