        <p>this first hidden reference is a reference to wizards.</p>
        <img src="wizerd.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          wizrds s are magical people that can use magic and preform magic on
          things or people. sometimes they help the hero in a movie like this
          wizerd does in the lego movie
        </p>
        <p>
          there is also a hidden easter egg in the background
          <mark style="background-color: rgba(0, 131, 200, 50)">

        <h2>
          another hidden refernce found only a few times in the movie is a
          reference to tacos
        </h2>
        <img src="tacos.gif" alt="" />
        <p>
          Tacos are a poplar mexican dish served as a side item for pizza or
          sometimes with cereal
        </p>
        <p>this is hinted at in the movie when they speak about tacos</p>
        <h1>one other hiddne refernce is the movie in when they say space.</h1>
        <img src="space.jpeg" alt="" />
        <p>

          even say he was a spaceman.
